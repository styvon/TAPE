Description: Test with Adjusted Phenotype and Empirical saddlepoint approximation in linear mixed model (TAPE) uses adjusted phenotype capable of differentiating various family disease history configurations, and controls for case-control imbalance by empirical saddlepoint approximation. In addition to genetic relatedness, TAPE further accounts for sparse close relatedness in the variance component model to control for type I error rates.
